# react-interval-calendar
Infinite scrolling based calendar for interval dates built with React.

### Development
Local development is broken into two parts (ideally using two terminal tabs).

First, run rollup to watch your `src/` module and automatically recompile it into `dist/` whenever you make changes.
```bash
$ npm start
```
The second part will be running the `example/` create-react-app that's linked to the local version of your module.
```bash
$ cd example
$ npm start
```
